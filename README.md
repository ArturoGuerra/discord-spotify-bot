# Spotify Discord Bot

Using a spotify account to play music in Discord.


## Requirements

- discord.py@async
- pyspotify
- Python 3.5.1+


## Notes

You need a Spotify Premium account to use this bot. This bot is mainly made for
playing music in on one server for friends and has not been tested against anything
else. It is unlikely that it will.

It's not a perfect bot, so expect to have to restart it from time to time.

If you queue something up before it has started to play, you will have to issue
a play command afterwards.


## Installation
Fill in the config.py. Token is the discord token. You also need pyspotify and a Spotify appkey, follow the instructions for this in https://pyspotify.mopidy.com/
